# Narratives and Checkpoints Guidelines

_Read the content standards for expectations for [narratives](http://curriculum-documentation.codecademy.com/Content-Standards/narrative/), [checkpoints](http://curriculum-documentation.codecademy.com/Content-Standards/checkpoint/), and [hints](http://curriculum-documentation.codecademy.com/Content-Standards/hint/)._ 

This draft of narratives and checkpoints is a place to write out narratives and checkpoints as they will appear in Codecademy's learning environment.

Some example narratives and checkpoints drafts:

* [Learn React: Hooks](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LUzKynRmf6V8_oaaTUk8DiTChnj1IqS5kOncOs49HE8/edit)
* [Learn Kotlin: Loops](https://docs.google.com/document/d/148Qr1lV0KDa5EPXJ1VeAU0kVReQuBu2FSpQS6DD4xHU/edit)

You will see that the Hooks lesson's narrative and checkpoints draft includes code for _initial savepoint_ and _final savepoint_. You don't need to include these in the draft, but if you want some feedback on the workspace code example, or if you think it will help explain the checkpoints, you can include a link to / copy of the workspace code here.

## Exercise 1: _Insert exercise title here._

### Narrative:

Important points from the content standards:

* Narrative of first exercise should have a hook. 
* Narrative of first exercise should provide an overview of what the lesson will cover.
* Narratives include key terms and their definitions
  * When a key term is first introduced, it can be in *italics*.
  * Definitions and explanation of code syntax should be written out in full sentences, rather than in bullet points.
  * Code syntax examples should be written in code blocks
* Narratives may include links to external resources when necessary
  * New functions & variables can link to reference page

### Instructions:

1. Checkpoint: _Insert checkpoint text here._

Important points from the content standards:

* Checkpoints provide instructions to learners and evaluate learner code with tests.
  * Each checkpoint requires tests to evaluate whether the learner has entered in the correct code per instructions.
  * A "Default Pass" checkpoint is also available -- this does not require learners to write any code / write correct code to progress through the lesson. This is most commonly used for the first exercise and the review exercise.

Hint: _Insert optional but recommended hint text here._

Important points from the content standards:

* A hint is a suggestion/tip for how to complete a checkpoint
  * A hint should not directly reveal the answer.
* Not all checkpoints require hints, **but** ideally all checkpoints should have hints.

2. Checkpoint: _Insert checkpoint text here._

Hint: _Insert optional but recommended hint text here._
