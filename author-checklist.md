# Author Checklist

**After moving a lesson into Author, please go through the following steps for every exercise before submitting your lesson for review:** 

* Check the default workspace:
  * Restore default workspace 
  * Check that the starting code looks correct
  * Check the file structure and make sure everything you need is there; delete any unused/outdated files
    * Create a "test" folder if you're working with JavaScript (this houses the tests, which won't run without this folder)
  * Make any other necessary changes and re-save the workspace
  * Confirm that the file name(s) that you want open in the workspace match the file name(s) specified in Author. **Note:** if you're getting a "file has been moved" error, check that the the file name does not have an extra invisible space in the text field in Author 
  * Confirm that the slug name for the workspace is correct, matches the one that's linked in Author, and follows Codecademy standards
* Check the initial savepoint:
  * Get initial savepoint
  * Make sure that the default workspace and initial savepoint match
  * If not, edit accordingly and re-upload the initial savepoint
* Check the final savepoint:
  * Get final savepoint
  * Make sure that the code looks correct and edit/re-upload the savepoint if necessary
  * Check that the final savepoint passes all checkpoints:
    * Sometimes learners will “View Solution” and then try running the code for each checkpoint, so we should make sure that the final savepoint passes all the earlier checkpoints
    * With the final savepoint loaded in the workspace, set progress to this exercise (shortcut: click on the narrative panel and use ctrl-s on a Mac) to remove pre-populated green checks
    * Press "Run" for all of the checkpoints and make sure that the tests all pass; if not troubleshoot and fix tests accordingly
      * Note: If you're getting a gray X on any of the checkpoints, it’s possible you have a syntax error somewhere in your test 
* Check each test separately:
  * Set progress to this exercise
  * For each checkpoint:
    * Type in an incorrect solution (it's a good idea to try multiple incorrect solutions addressing common/expected mistakes)
    * Make sure that the incorrect solution fails the test
    * Make sure that the error message(s) is correct, formatted correctly, and provides the learner with a useful hint about how to correct their mistake
    * Change the code to the correct solution and make sure the correct solution passes
