# Quiz

Check out the [content standards](http://curriculum-documentation.codecademy.com/Content-Standards/quiz/) for guidance on writing quiz assessments.

Important points from the content standards:

* A quiz is a collection of assessments that is surfaced to the learner in a random order.  It is intended to test a learners understanding of the learning standards covered in the preceding lesson.
* First answer of an assessment should be the **correct answer** (for maintainability).
* Don't use answers like "All of the above" or "None of the above" because answers are randomized.
* Negative words are highlighted with capitalization, like "Which of these is NOT true?"

Each assessment of a quiz should be associated to at least one learning standard (meaning you can test multiple learning standards within a single assessment). All learning standards of a module (if your module has more than one lesson, the quiz should test for learning standards from all lessons in the module) should be covered in the quiz.

Some example quiz drafts:

## Multiple Choice Assessments
Check out the [content standards](http://curriculum-documentation.codecademy.com/Content-Standards/multiple-choice/) for guidance on multiple choice assessments.

* A multiple choice assessment contains a question stem and 2 or more answer choices, of which only one can be correct. It optionally may also include an image or a code block to accompany the question stem.
  * Ideally, a mutliple choice assessment should have 4 answer choices.

_Question prompt_

Learning Standard UUID(s):

* All learning standards have been uploaded to Author. There should be a table for the learning standards in each lesson outlines doc with UUIDs next to each learning standard. Please provide a list of UUIDs of learning standards that associates to the assessment.
* To view a learning standard in author, go to `http://author.codecademy.com/learning-standards/` + UUID.

Response: _Correct response_
Reason: _Affirmation. Optional reason why this response is correct._

- Reason text is displayed after a learner has selected an answer.
- If you provide a reason for a correct answer, start it with a one- or two-word affirmation like 'Well done!' or 'Correct!'

## Fill In The Code (FITC) Assessments
Check out the [content standards](http://curriculum-documentation.codecademy.com/Content-Standards/fill-in-the-code/) for guidance on Fill In The Code (FITC) assessments.

* A Fill in the Code assessment contains a question stem and a partially completed code block, along with a variety of correct and incorrect code snippets that the learner must select to complete the code block correctly.
