# Quiz

Check out the [content standards](http://curriculum-documentation.codecademy.com/quizzes/quiz-standards/) for guidance on writing quiz assessments.

Important points from the content standards:

* A quiz is a collection of assessments that is surfaced to the learner in a random order.  It is intended to test a learners understanding of the learning standards covered in the preceding lesson. 
* First answer of a multiple-choice assessment should be the **correct answer** (for maintainability).
* Don't use answers like "All of the above" or "None of the above" because answers are randomized.
* Negative words are highlighted with capitalization, like "Which of these is NOT true?"

**Each assessment of a quiz should be associated to at least one learning standard** (meaning you can test multiple learning standards within a single assessment). All learning standards of a module should be covered in the quiz. If your module has more than one lesson, the quiz should test for learning standards from all lessons in the module.
